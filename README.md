## Overview

UMP (Universal Messaging Protocol) is a modern, secure, and extensible messaging protocol designed for end-to-end encrypted communication across multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile, web, and IoT devices.  

The protocol prioritizes **security, privacy, and interoperability**, providing developers with a robust framework for building messaging applications or integrating secure messaging into existing systems.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: AES-256 / ChaCha20 with digital signatures (ECDSA or post-quantum options).  
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys for each session to prevent retrospective decryption.  
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication using public/private keys, OAuth2, or token-based methods.  
- **Multi-Transport Support**: TCP, QUIC, WebSocket, and optional Tor support for anonymous messaging.  
- **Message Types**: Supports text, media, and system messages.  
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable for additional features such as file transfer, streaming, or ephemeral channels.  
- **Open Standard**: Fully documented and open-source for community contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (for core libraries and client/server implementation)  
- Go 1.23+ (for API and microservices)  
- Node.js 20+ (optional, for prototyping or web client)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skygenesisenterprise/ump-protocol.git
cd ump-protocol
````

2. Build the Rust core libraries:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Build Go microservices:

```bash
cd services
go build ./...
```

## Usage

UMP messages are serialized using **Protocol Buffers** (protobuf) or **FlatBuffers** to ensure interoperability between Rust, Go, and other client languages.

Basic steps for sending a message:

1. Generate ephemeral session keys.
2. Encrypt the message payload using the recipient’s public key.
3. Sign the message with the sender’s private key.
4. Send the message through a UMP relay server or directly via supported transports.
